# SQL for Data Analysis
In this project, I used Parch and Posey database to explore different functional aspects of SQL from basic to advanced.

Parch and Posey is a hypothetical paper company's sales data of different types of paper (standard, gloss, poster). The database consists of different tables linked with a database schema. If you want to create a database from scratch, you can use the already written code in the parch and posey text file, found in the Table_files.sql.

All you need to do is to create the parch and posey database using the code 'CREATE DATABASE parch_and_posey'

And then copy the codes for the creation of the different tables and run it in MYSQL, Microsft SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.

It's good to know that MYSQL was used for this project.
